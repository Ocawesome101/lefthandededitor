# LEDIT

A simple text editor written in pure Lua.
Partially an experiment in making an editor primarily controlled by
the left hand.  I'm left-handed, so this makes sense.

A few keybinds operate on a "cut buffer." Every cut/copy operation appends to
this buffer, so `X` and then `10` is equivalent to `x` 10 times.

Lowercase commands work in insert mode when accompanied by `ctrl`, e.g. `e`
becomes `Ctrl-E`.

Uppercase commands may only be used while not in insert mode.

Keys:
  - w/W move 1/5 lines up
  - s/S move 1/5 lines down
  - a/A move 1/5 chars right
  - d/D move 1/5 chars left
  - e toggle insert mode
  - i scroll up 5 lines
  - k scroll down 5 lines
  - I jump to line 1
  - K jump to last line
  - j jump to col 1
  - l jump to last col
  - q quit if saved
  - Q quit unconditionally (needs double-press)
  - r jump to line N
  - c/C copy 1 line/copy N lines
  - x/X cut 1 line/cut N lines
  - v paste contents of cut buffer, and clear it
  - V paste contents of cut buffer
  - m insert blank line (equivalent to 'Return')
  - z remove last line of cut buffer
  - Z clear cut buffer
  - t save file
  - T save file (always prompt for fname)
